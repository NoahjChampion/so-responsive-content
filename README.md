## Languages

Naturally the SO Responsive Content plugin has been fully internationalized. In the languages directory you will find the .pot file and the .po file. I already have added the Dutch translation files.

The plugin only contains 38 strings (of which many only 1 word); it would be a awesome if you can help me translate it into other languages!
